    //let's try console.log
       var test="this is the variable";
       console.log("this is an example"); //and it will show in the page
       console.log(test); //if you want it to show what's in the variable, you type
       //the name of the variable inside the console. Is a way of testing your code.

       //useful during development and debbuging!

    // Instructions:
    // Create 3 variables. One called: "name", one called "pizzaCount", and one called "isHungry".
    // The name variable should be set to your name.
    // The pizzaCount variable should be set to a number.
    // The isHungry variable should be set to true or false.

    // FILL IN YOUR CODE HERE
    // =============================================


    // ==============================================


    // Don't touch this code :-)
    var name = "Annette";
    var pizzaCount = 3;
    var isHungry = false;
    var totalCost = pizzaCount * 5.00; //this is an operation. We are performin an operation
    //on the right side. and we are asigning the result of that operation to whatever is on 
    //the left side.

    alert("Welcome: " + name); //here again, is another operation. that operation is called 
    //concatenation, it concatenates 2 strings into one string. Thos is going to put the 2 
    //together and is going to return the result of putting those 2 as a whole.

    alert("Pizzas cost $5 each"); 

    alert("Your total is: $" + totalCost);//this one is a bit confusing in js, is used both for concatenating
    //strings and for a logical which is additional to numbers.

    alert("Still Hungry: " + isHungry); //this is a boolean.

    //in this case the prompt will show me that my name is Annette, that pizzas cost $5 each, 
    //that my total is $15, and it will ask me if I'm still hungry, and it will show "false". 
    //What a variable does is that it takes a little space from the RAM of my computer, and uses
    //it to store and retrive information. 
    
    //Now we'll move to CONSOLE.LOG
    // is a tool for developers to know if there's an error.
