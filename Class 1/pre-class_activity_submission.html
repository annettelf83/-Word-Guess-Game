    first, code dissection (this code here)<br>
    What's JavaScript? <br>
    JavaScript is a programming language. We already know a webpage has HTML and CSS
    But they only give you visuals: structure, content, and design, with no functionality.<br>
    JavaScript is a programming language used by the browser to allow you to add functionality 
    to your page.<br>
    Functionality means Interaction between the user and the page; reacting and responding to
    users Interactions with your page.<br>

  <br>VARIABLES</br>

  <br>Analogy of the egg: <br>
  to boil an egg we have to do some steps.<br>
  The egg itself is the INPUT. Input is basically what you give. The initial information 
  given to the program in order to work.<br>
  If its a programm that boils an egg, that program needs an egg. <br>
  So, on step 1 we don't use the egg up to 3 or 4 steps after.<br>
  But you needed the egg and you had to have the egg somewhere. that somewhere is 
  what we call Variables. <br>
  Variables allows us to store information (container) that we want to use afterwards.<br>
  Like puting an egg in a bag, until the water boils and we do the other steps, and then 
  we pick the egg from that bag (container) and we finally use it. And we are the ones 
  who decide and create how many variables i need or what information we're going to be 
  putting in my variable. <br>
  the way to DECLARE variables on JS is var myVariable; <br>
  Variables are the nouns of programming.<br>
  Variables can contain: numbers, strings and booleans. These are what we call VALUES. <br>
  The 3 first PRIMITIVE values that we will use are:<br>
    . var name = "Snow White"; (strings, which means text)<br>
    . var dwarfCount = 7; (numbers -0,1,2,3-)<br>
    . var isSleeping = true; (booleans -true or false-)<br>
Note: Concepts is what matters the most in any language. Almost any program uses
variables and they have the same use and the same functionality. The only thing that 
changes is the syntax.<br>
   Variables can hold any kind of value (but there's no such thing as "anything" in programming)
  theres only a predefined set of possible TYPES of values, as we saw above (primitive values).<br> 
  We are using DATA of one of those TYPES.<br>
  Variables are composed by a Name, and then we can STORE values in those variables. <br>
  From the moment we establish the var, the browser knows (or javascript knows) that 
  whenever we say e.g. "name", we want to get whatever we stored there.<br>
  So if we say get the egg form the bag, we knoe the bag (var) is what contains the egg
  e.g. var bag = "egg";<br>
  Writing styes are called conventions, these are for example, using a capital letter to 
  denote the second word on a variable, like: eggBag, myName, etc. This standard naming 
  convention is called CamelCase. Theres also PascalCase: UpperCaseChar.<br>
  If later on we want to change the value that that varianle is storing, you just have 
  write the name = and asing the new value. <br>
  So, the syntax structure is: var keyword (var), the variable name "princess", the assignment
  (=) which is also an operator; assignes what's on the right to what's on the left.<br>
  the value ("Snow White") and termination (;). When useing strings must use quotations. <br>
  Errors in progam occur weather as a syntax error or logical errors: the eggs instead
  of coming out boiled is coming out fried.<br>
  JavaScript, same as in CSS, we have 3 ways of incorporating it in out page.<br>
  2- Script tag: whatever we put inside there, the browser is going to treat it as 
  javascript code.<br>
  From now on, when we talk about programming, you always have to think like this: <br>
  step 1, step 2, step 3... and so on. What are the steps to make sure it always 
  does the same, and trying to draw a picture in your mind, because now is not longer
  the visualization of the page that goes in the actual outputting, and then, you can 
  write it down, but still, you must have these steps very clear before writing any code. <br>
  programing is nothing but translating instructions to a language that a computer can 
  comprehend.(see down to empiric class)

  <script type="text/javascript">
  //var myName and assign your name to that variable
  var myName = "Annette"; //now, if I want my algorithm to show whatever my name is, instead of 
  //passing the text "Hello world" I have to pass the value of the myName variable. And to pass
  //the value of the myName variable, you simply pass the mane of the variable
//before doing any variables we'll do an alert
    alert(myName); //this is a string (changed Hello world with myName)
    //what's the algorithm for  this? that algorithm gives the same output given the same input.
    //Input that uses to open the page, output: there's an alert that says, hello world.
    //and this is how we must think about this.
    //Here, basically, we're telling the computer: "chrome, display an alert with this text."
    //Now, let's create a variable on top of the alert: (check up)
    //Now we want to show a second alert. But now we want to show a different name. In order to do that, we must change
    //the value of the variable. But the variable has been already declared, we don't have to use var from now on. If 
    //want to change the name of that variable we use the name equals the new value.
    myName = "john";
    //So this is the idea with variables.
    alert(myName);
    //ACTIVITY #3 (Pizza Variables)
  </script>
