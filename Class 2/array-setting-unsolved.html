     //In this exercise we will use the method .toLowerCase(), which is not for arrays
     //is for strings.The java string toLowerCase() 
     //method returns the string in lowercase letter. In other words, it 
     //converts all characters of the string into lower case letter. The toLowerCase() 
     //method works same as toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()) method. It internally uses 
     //the default locale.
    // Create an Array of Drinks with all capital letters
    // ...
    var drinks = ["Coke", "Pepsi", "Water", "Orange Juice"];

    //we learned that for arrays we have the .indexOf method so:
    //var index=drinks.indexOf("Coke");

    // all this methods will do something with the value of the variable that you
    //are applying the method for. In the case of .indexOf it will take the value of the 
    //variable, which is going to be an array. It will find the possition of the elemnt 
    //"Coke'" and then is going to give you that.
    //var myText="This is a text"; //string variables also have methods and properties so if you do:
    //var myLowerCaseText=myText.toLowerCase();
  //if i were to put .length it will show how many characters are in the text. .indexOf will give 
  //the possition of the letter in the text. Strings also have .toLowerCase()

    console.log("First statement");
    console.log(drinks[0].toLowerCase());
    console.log(drinks[1]);
    console.log(drinks[2]);
    console.log(drinks[3]);
    "This text".toLowerCase()
    console.log(coke.toLowerCase());
    var lcDrinks=drinks.toLowerCase();

    /*console.log("Coke".toLowerCase());
    console.log("Pepsi".toLowerCase());
    console.log("Water".toLowerCase());
    console.log("Orange Juice".toLowerCase());*/
    /*
    all  of the  styles have the same syntax. class ., id  #, div nothing. How  we apply elements? In the case of tags we don't have to do anything. 
    In case fo classes or ids we have to specify. I want the class that I create to be apply where I want. If i want it to be the id, I use the id style.
    You can apply as many classes as you want, you only have to separate them by spaces. 
    RESET is to hack the browser. Every browser defines their own style. What we do with reset is writing different styles
    Is nothing but styles you define that become the general style of the oage. 
    forking in github. It means cloning the repo, but is a new repo. It wont' affect the new version.

    // Then modify each element of the array (individually) to make them lowercase
   

    console.log("Second statement");
    console.log(drinks[0]);
    console.log(drinks[1]);
    console.log(drinks[2]);
    console.log(drinks[3]);
