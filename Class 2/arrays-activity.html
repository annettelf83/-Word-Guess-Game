      something back and has an argument. The argument is what goes inside (). So, if it has () is a
      method, if it doesn't have (), is a property. 
      Arrays also have methods, and one of them is the .indexOf, which takes 1 argument (whatever value
      you want to pass) and it's going to RETURN what's the index of that elemnt in that array. 
      Is going to tell you what's the position of "bear", but since is not in the array, it will 
      give you -1. Basically if .indexOf is negative, means that element does not belong in the array. 
      .indexOf must always gove you a number, those are the requirements of that method. When it gives
      you a possitive number, means the element exists.

      Arrays, as said before, has other methods and other properties as well. .lenght and .indexOf are 
      some of the most common ones that we will use. Method means that it belongs to a variable.
