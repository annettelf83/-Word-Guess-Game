//THE FOR LOOP
 
    // Creating an array of vegetables.
      var vegetables = ["Carrots", "Peas", "Lettuce", "Tomatoes"];
 // Looping through each item in the array and logging a message to the console.
      for (var i = 0; i < vegetables.length; i++) //var i is 0, and lower than var vegetables quantity (which is 3), 
      { 
        console.log("I love " + vegetables[i]);//the block of code says String + i*i?, then it makes an operation with i++.
  //this will add the "I love"  to the variable vegetables and loop it through its array. 
      }
//Professor explination: this loop integrates 3 things that we did with the previous one.
//In the syntax of the loop it asks you to declare an iterator. It asks you to define a condition,
// and it asks you to perform an operation into the iterator. 
//i++ is the same as doing i=i+1;. That's just a shotrhand to add 1 to the element to the left. 
//you can also do i-- i=i-1;. if i=i+2 is also i+=2.
//a for loop is also a loop

//1-set up the index of the loop:
var i = 1;
//2-check the condition
for (var i = 1; i < 10; 
//3- make sure you are incrementing the index (inside the loop, but at the end of it)
i++) 
//Block of Code (body of the loop)
{
  const element = array[index]; //do stuff
}
//The first time we hit this loop will create a variable called i, set it equal to 1, then will check if 
//is less than 10 (it is), we will jump into the loop, it will execute all the lines in the body of the loop.
//When we close the curly brace it will increment the index, check the condition again and will keep on looping 
//that condition is no longer true.
//the great thing about this is that is really readable, you don't have to go outside the loop to find the index 
//being set up, nor you have to scan inside the loop for the increment to know it's in the right place. 
//it's a very clear and straight forward way of setting up a loop.
