    /*How we check conditions? if\else statements are critical. Is composed of an if, else-if, or else(keyword),
    a condition, and the resulting code in {}  curly brackets. 
    This code is going to be executed if, and only if, the condition is true.
    else-if is similar, with the only difference that it's only going to check the condition if the previous one is false.
    then we have else, which can either come after an if or after an else-if, but it cannot be on it's own 
     
    an array is a variable that no longer has one value, but several.
    Our array of zoo animals. This is the way to represent an array, variable, name SQUARE BRACKETS, and then 
    separate the values with COMAS.
    var zooAnimals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl", 7];
    if we try to add a number to the array it will work fine. The same way as variables can have any
    values, in javascript arrays can have any types of values mixed up. This applys to javaScript, 
    but not to all programming languajes. All languages have arrays, all have variables, the difference
    is that in some programming languages arrays or variables can only have one type of value.

    then we wonder: how do we access the values in that array?
    To do that, you do the syntax:
    zooAnimals[0]; //this is the position within the list from where you want to get the value. 
    In this case arrays start at zero, so this would be the first position (zebra)
    So, if we want the browser to show those positions we can do alerts:
    alert(zooAnimals[0]);
    alert(zooAnimals[1]);
    alert(zooAnimals[2]);
    alert(zooAnimals[3]);
    alert(zooAnimals[4]);
    then do this:
    alert(zooAnimals.length); //this alert will show how many values (4) the array has. 
    /*So lenght seems to refer to quantity. Here I'm using the variable, but I'm not accesing the value.
    We're using the dot, this is called a proverb. Basically what's happening here is that, even though 
    we're simply asigning the value to our variable, javascript kind if wraps that value inside something
    else that allows you to learn and do things with those values as well. So, you can read the value and 
    also do things with them. Now, .lenght will give you how many items are in the array. 

    Arrays can have any kind of value. You can even have arrays inside arrays. Array a type of variable that are collections.
    these collections can be made up of strings, numbers, booleans, other arrays, objects, anything.
    Each element of the array is marked by an index. Indexes always start with 0. So the index is the position of the element in the array.
    E.g. The index of the first element is 0, the index of the second one is 1, and so on.
    

    to access the values of the arrays the syntax is: 
    1- name of the variable which holds the array, 
    2- Square brackets []
    3- inside [] the number of the position the value you want has in the array.


    // Prints 4 to the console because there are 4 items in our zooAnimals array.
    console.log(zooAnimals.length);

    // Prints Rhino to the console. Remember, the first item in an array has an index position of 0!
    console.log(zooAnimals[1]);

    // Prints undefined... because the last index ("Owl") is 3.
    console.log(zooAnimals[4]);
